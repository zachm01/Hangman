# Hangman
Two modes: computer chooses a word and the user guesses or the user chooses a word and the computer guesses. Current word length limit for user is 9 letters, soon to be increased. To be added is a difficulty setting.

This program uses letter frequencies and probabilities to guess the most likely letter to come next in a word. There are likely many better ways to for this to be implemented, but this is my first attempt at a program that is largely founded in math.

# Usage
This is terminal text interface game. Tkinter graphics are pending. 

# Bugs
There are many. Beware. Feedback is appreciated.
